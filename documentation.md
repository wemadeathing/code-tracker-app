# CodeTracker Documentation

## Overview

CodeTracker is a comprehensive time tracking application designed specifically for developers to monitor time spent on coding activities. The application allows users to track time spent on different courses and projects, organize activities within these items, and visualize their coding habits through statistics and reports.



### 1. Time Tracking

The application provides a timer interface that allows users to:
- Start, pause, and resume timing sessions
- Select a course/project and optionally an activity to track
- Add notes to completed sessions
- View elapsed time during active sessions



### 2. Item Management

Users can create and manage two types of items:
- **Courses**: For learning and educational activities
- **Projects**: For work-related coding tasks



### 3. Activity Management

Activities provide a way to break down items into smaller, trackable units:
- Each activity belongs to a specific item (course or project)
- Activities are optional when tracking time
- Activities help organize work within larger items



### 4. Statistics Dashboard

The dashboard provides visual insights into coding habits:
- Time distribution across different items
- Daily/weekly/monthly time tracking patterns
- Comparison between course and project time allocation



### 5. Session History

Users can review their past coding sessions:
- Filter sessions by date, item, or activity
- Sort sessions by various criteria
- Delete sessions with confirmation
